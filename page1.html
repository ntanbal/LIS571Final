                    <h1>WHAT IS ETHICS</h1>
                    <p>Technology is rapidly advancing, with new models and systems coming out faster and faster, 
                        being used by more and more people. As the prevalence of technology continues to rise, ideas 
                        about the right and wrong ways to use it develop too. The technology industry must be held 
                        accountable for its practices, products, and their impacts on society. But how and to what 
                        extent this must be done is still being discussed, especially as the ever changing nature of 
                        technology makes it difficult for standards to address every concern.</p>
