                    <h1>ETHICAL HACKING</h1>
                    <p>Hacking is the act of illegally breaking into a computer system 
                        (Evans, Martin & Poatsy, 2021, p. 329). While many people may 
                        be familiar with the harm hacking causes, such as stealing 
                        information or damaging property, there are other types of 
                        hackers who consider themselves to be ethical hackers. Ethical
                         hackers, also referred to as white-hat hackers, break into 
                         computer systems for benevolent reasons including to help find 
                         security vulnerabilities within the system and expose them to 
                         the companies that own the systems and their users (Evans, Martin & Poatsy, 2021, p. 329). 
                         An important distinction to make is that typically white-hat hackers work with the 
                         organizations they are hacking into, making their actions legal<br></p>
