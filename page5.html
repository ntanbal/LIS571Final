                    <h1>DIGITAL LITERACY</h1>
                    <p>Daily life in a digital world requires literacy and awareness. 
                        Especially with the introduction of AI, here are some considerations
                         when engaging with others on the internet:</p>
                         <ol>
                            <li>
                                <p>Learn to identify AI-generated content:<br>
                                    Ensure that you do not misrepresent a situation by sharing this content maliciously.
                                     Deep fakes have become more realistic as AI advances, but you can still inspect these
                                      portrayals by zooming in on eyes, teeth, fingers; or by searching the internet for 
                                      reliable sources
                               
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>Generate personal AI content according to ethics:<br>
                                    Exercise caution when generating your own AI content. If a website offers AI
                                     generation for free, you are the commodity it is pursuing.
                              
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>Build your algorithmic awareness:<br>
                                    Better understanding of how AI works ultimately empowers consumers each opportunity they have to interact with it.
                              
                            </li>
